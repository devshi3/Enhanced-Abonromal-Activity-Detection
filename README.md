# Enhanced-Abonromal-Activity-Detection
Video analysis has undergone a radical transformation
thanks to the quick development of deep learning and
computer vision techniques, especially in the area of anomalous
activity detection. Robust abnormal activity recognition
algorithms are a prerequisite for strong security and safety
protocols, which has led to the investigation of novel approaches.
This work examined the combination of two state-of-the-art
classifiers—Long Short-Term Memory, or LSTM, and Time
Series AI, or TSAI—with cutting-edge techniques for object
tracking and recognition, such as YOLOv8 (You Only Look
Once, version 8) and Deep SORT (Simple Online and real-time
tracking). The suggested method attempted to precisely identify
anomalous activities in video feeds by utilizing the skills of LSTM
and TSAI in capturing temporal dependencies and analyzing
sequential data, along with the real-time object tracking abilities
of Deep SORT and accurate object detection of YOLOv8. The
performance of the integrated system was evaluated utilizing
precision, recall, and F1-score metrics during an extensive examination
that covered a variety of datasets and situations, resulting
in an astounding 97.22% accuracy. With the ultimate goal of
improving the system’s practical usefulness in real-world settings
across industries like retail, disaster management, healthcare,
and building security, the study also investigated the effects of
various configurations and parameters on the system’s efficacy.
By improving video analysis techniques, this research helps
enterprises improve security protocols and successfully maintain
public safety.
